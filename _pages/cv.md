## Education
<!-- ====== -->
* B.S. in Computer Science, NanFang College of Sun Yat-Sen University, *Sept. 2016 - Jun. 2020*

## Work experience
<!-- ====== -->
* Research Assistant: *NanFang College of Sun Yat-Sen University, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Center (BAC), Guangzhou, China* *Sept. 2018 - Jun. 2020* 

A forecasting research on daily precipitation in the real-world dataset: Through the collection, cleansing, and reconstruction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) dataset which contains the daily weather information that is recorded by over 100,000 observation sites worldwide from 1800 to 2017, an integrated rainfall forecasting model was proposed for multi-site predictions with kriging methods and utilized the State-of-the-art Deep Learning (DL) and Broad Learning System (BLS), which can reach an accuracy of 86.9%.

  * Wrote a paper named Daily Rainfall Data Construction and Application to Weather Prediction: A pilot study which has been accepted by ISCAS 2018.
  * Wrote a paper named Prediction of daily precipitation based on deep learning and broad learning techniques: A pilot
study which has been accepted by ISKE 2019.

* Medical Clinical Data Analyst: *Guangzhou Aid Cloud (Guangdong Traditional Chinese Medicine Big Data Center)* *Sept. 2020 - Aug. 2021*

Medical clinical data study: Responsible for clinical data analysis in the Grade III Level A hospitals in China, using statistics, machine learning, and causal inference techniques to build a clinical predictive model and explore the impact of independent risk factors on outcome events in clinical research, and use deep learning to recognize oral pathology images and predict hypotension waveforms.

  * Cooperate with clinicians to explore the application of machine learning in clinical medicine, develop clinical research ideas using machine learning, and co-author academic papers.
  * Co-authored paper in press: An explainable supervised machine learning predictor of acute kidney injury after adult
deceased donor liver transplantation, which has been accepted by the Journal of Translational Medicine.
  * Co-authored paper under review: Perioperative Methylprednisolone was a risk factor for postoperative pulmonary complications in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.

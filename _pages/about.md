I worked at [Guangzhou Aid Cloud Company](http://aidcloud.cn/#/) as a Medical Clinical Data Analyst after graduating. I received my Bachelor Degree from NanFang College of Sun Yat-Sen University and worked with [Prof. Choujun Zhan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CQjEUkAAAAAJ&hl=en) from Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Center (BAC) on Deep Learning and Time Series. My main methodological interest lies in machine learning, deep learning, data mining and causal inference with their applications in Healthcare. Please feel free to contact me via email. Thanks!

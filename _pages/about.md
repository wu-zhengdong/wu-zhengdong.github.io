I am Zhengdong Wu. I received Bachelor Degree from NanFang College of Sun Yat-Sen University. I conducted clinical research at a clinical data analysis company in Guangzhou after graduating. Currently, I am an AI Programmer (RA II) for the Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (DÂ²4H) and a part-time Research Assistant at the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong (HKU), supervised by Prof. Kathy Leung. My main methodological interest lies in machine learning, deep learning, data mining and causal inference with their applications in healthcare. Please feel free to contact me via email!

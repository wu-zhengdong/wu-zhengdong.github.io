I am Zhengdong Wu. I received Bachelor Degree from NanFang College of Sun Yat-Sen University. I worked at [Guangzhou Aid Cloud Company](http://aidcloud.cn/#/) as a Medical Clinical Data Analyst after graduating. Currently, I am an AI Programmer (RA II) for the [Laboratory of Data Discovery for Health (DÂ²4H)](https://www.d24h.hk/) and a part-time Research Assistant at the [School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong (HKU)](https://sph.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Kathy Leung](https://sph.hku.hk/en/Biography/Leung-Sze-Man-Kathy) and [Prof. Joseph Wu](https://sph.hku.hk/zh-HK/Biography/Wu%20Tsz%20Kei%20Joseph). My main methodological interest lies in machine learning, deep learning, data mining and causal inference with their applications in healthcare. Please feel free to contact me via email!
